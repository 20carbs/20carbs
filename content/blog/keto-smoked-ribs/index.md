These ribs are to die for.  I mean, who doesn't love a good rack of ribs.  They have the right amount of smoke, and if you are like me, you want them to have a good kick to them.  And amazingly, these are low carb Keto Friendly.

First, I apply a dry rub and let it sit overnight to absorb all of that flavor.  When ready to cook, I use the 3-2-1 method.  Three hours, cooking at 220 - 230 degrees F.  Apply wood chunks if you want smokiness to the ribs.

After the 3 hours, take the ribs out and drizzle the BBQ sauce along with some lemon juice.  Wrap the entire rack with foil.  This is going to essentially steam the ribs so that they will be fall of the bone.  Put the ribs back in the Smoker, and let it bake for another 2 hours.

Once the two hours are up, remove the ribs from the foil, and smother with the BBQ sauce.  Bake for another 1 hour.

These are the tastiest, most fall of the bone and juiciest ribs you will ever have.  If you prefer less smoke, I recommend only putting in wood chunks during the first 3 hours.  Also, place a tray with water under the ribs so that the bottom of the ribs don't over burn.

**Ingredients:**

* 1x Rack of Ribs
* Keto BBQ Sauce:
  * 2 cups Sugar Free Ketchup
  * 1/2 cup Sugar Replacement
  * 1 Tbsp Liquid Smoke
  * 1 Tbsp Paprika
* Dry Rub
  * 2 tsp Paprika
  * 1 tsp Cayenne
  * 1 tsp Salt
  * 1 tsp Garlic Powder
  * 1 tsp Chilli Powder
* Smoker
  * Organic Brick Charcoal
  * Applewood Wood Chunks

**Directions:**

 1. Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs.
 2. Generously rub the dry rub all of the ribs, top and bottom and sides.
 3. Wrap with plastic wrap, and let sit overnight in the fridge (minimum 4 hours).
 4. When ready to cook, prepare your smoker to 220 deg F.  Then add wood chunks for smoke.
 5. Place the rack of ribs on the lowest level.  You want to cook these low and slow for 3 hours.  Do not peek while its cooking else you will lose some of that valuable smoke.
 6. While the ribs are smoking, start preparing the Keto BBQ Sauce.  Stir all sauce ingredients in a non stick sauce pan, and stir until sauce is bubbling and ingredients are dissolved.  Let cool.
 7. After 3 hours, remove the rack from the Smoker.  Place on top of some foil, and drizzle 1/2 cup of Keto BBQ Sauce mixed with 1/2 cup Lime Juice.  Wrap the foil so that the liquid cannot escape.  Cook for another 2 hours.
 8. After 2 hours, remove the ribs from the Smoker.  Remove the foil, and slather on 1/4 cup of Keto BBQ sauce.  Put the ribs back in the smoker (open this time) for another 1 hour.
 9. When the final hour is up, remove the ribs and let rest for 5 minutes.
10. Cut the ribs (I prefer into pieces of 2 ribs), and slather on more Keto BBQ sauce to enjoy.

**Modifications**

* If you prefer less smoke, use less wood chunks, and only apply during the first 3 hours.
* If you want less spice, reduce the amount of chili powder in both the Keto BBQ sauce and the Dry Rub.
* If you want non Keto, then use real sugar.
